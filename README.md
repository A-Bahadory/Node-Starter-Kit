# Node Starter Kit

This repo supports trainees building projects in Node and Express for the first time.

However you could just as easily do this and not bother cloning this project.

```zsh
mkdir Node-Starter-Kit && cd Node-Starter-Kit
npm init -y
npm install express
touch readme.md && touch server.js && touch .gitignore
```
